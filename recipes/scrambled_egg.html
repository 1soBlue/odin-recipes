                <h2>Description</h2>
                Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking eggs with a small amount of milk or cream, and then cooking the mixture in a pan until the eggs are set and fluffy. Scrambled eggs can be served on their own or as part of a larger breakfast spread, and are a quick and easy way to start your day.

                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a non-stick pan, heat a small amount of butter or oil over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the butter or oil is hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan and let it cook for 15-20 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges of the eggs towards the center of the pan, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process until the eggs are cooked through and no longer runny.</li>
                    <li>Once the eggs are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate.</li>
                </ul>
