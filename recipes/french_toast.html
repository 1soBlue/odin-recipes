                <h2>Description</h2>
                French toast, also known as pain perdu, is a classic breakfast dish that is made by soaking slices of bread in a mixture of eggs, milk, and cinnamon, and then frying them until they are golden brown. The result is a deliciously sweet and eggy breakfast that is perfect for weekend mornings or brunch.         </p>
