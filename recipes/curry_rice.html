                <h2>Description</h2>
                Japanese Curry Rice, or simply "Curry Rice" as it is commonly known in Japan, is a popular and beloved dish that consists of a thick and flavorful curry sauce served over a bed of fluffy white rice. Japanese curry is a sweeter, milder version of Indian or Thai curries, and is often made with a blend of spices that includes curry powder, cumin, coriander, and turmeric, along with other ingredients such as onions, carrots, potatoes, and meat or seafood.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil and heat until hot.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken or beef to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside. Add the onions and a pinch of salt to the pot and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Add 3 cups of water or chicken broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                    <li>Break the Japanese curry roux into pieces and add it to the pot. Stir until the roux has melted and the sauce has thickened.</li>
                    <li>Return the meat to the pot and stir to combine. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through.</li>
